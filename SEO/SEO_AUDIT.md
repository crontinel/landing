# Crontinel Landing - SEO Audit

**Audited:** 2026-04-09 (static file analysis - no live URL fetching)
**Scope:** `/Users/ray/Work/crontinel/landing/src/`

## Summary

The foundation is strong. Base.astro handles canonical URLs, OG tags, Twitter cards, and JSON-LD globally. All key pages pass custom titles and descriptions. The biggest gaps are missing structured data on individual pages, some nav/internal link gaps, and a few metadata improvements.

## Quick Wins (< 30 min each)

1. **Add `twitter:site` tag to Base.astro** - one line, improves Twitter card attribution
   ```html
   <meta name="twitter:site" content="@crontinel" />
   ```

2. **Add About to Nav** - add `{ href: '/about', label: 'About' }` to `Nav.astro` `navLinks`

3. **Add About + Pricing + Features to Footer** - 3 links to add to `Footer.astro`

4. **Improve pricing page title** - change from `"Pricing - Crontinel"` to `"Pricing - Crontinel Laravel Monitoring"` to include target keyword

5. **Improve features page title** - change from `"Features - Crontinel"` to `"Features - Crontinel Laravel Cron & Queue Monitoring"`

6. **Add FAQPage JSON-LD to pricing.astro** - the FAQ content is already there; adding the schema block is ~30 min work

## Longer Improvements (prioritize by page traffic)

### High priority

- **SoftwareApplication JSON-LD on homepage + features** - Google uses this to show rich results for software tools. Include `name`, `applicationCategory`, `operatingSystem`, `offers` (free tier), `featureList`.

- **Mobile nav hamburger menu** - nav links are hidden on mobile. Users can't navigate to Features, Pricing, or Blog on mobile without typing the URL. This also hurts crawl equity distribution on mobile-first indexing.

- **VS pages internal link discovery** - VS pages exist in sitemap but are orphaned (no links from any navigable page). Add a "Compare alternatives" section to the features page or a sidebar on the pricing page that links to `/vs/better-stack`, `/vs/cronitor`, etc.

- **Use-case pages internal link discovery** - same problem as VS pages. Add a "Use cases" section to homepage or nav.

### Medium priority

- **Per-page og:image for VS and use-cases** - custom social preview images for each comparison page will significantly increase click-through rate when these URLs are shared.

- **Article/BlogPosting JSON-LD** - check `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`; add schema to each blog post.

- **BreadcrumbList on VS / use-case / integration pages** - improves SERP display for these pages.

- **Integrations page discovery** - add an `/integrations` index page linked from the nav or footer.

### Lower priority

- **`<meta name="robots">` explicit control** - currently relying on no-robots-meta + robots.txt allow. Explicit `index,follow` on key pages adds clarity.
- **Hreflang** - if multilingual support is ever planned, add early.
- **Performance / Core Web Vitals** - out of scope for static analysis; run Lighthouse on live site.
